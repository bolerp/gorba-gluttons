# 🗑️ Gorba-Gluttons

**Feed the Beast • Rule the Heap • Become the King**

The ultimate trash game on Gorbagana network. Feed Gorba-Glutton, generate Stink, and become the King of the Heap!

## 🎮 What is Gorba-Gluttons?

Gorba-Gluttons is an interactive on-chain game built for the Gorbagana network (a Solana fork). Players act as "Trash Collectors" who feed the insatiable Gorba-Glutton monster by making transactions. Each transaction generates "Stink" points, and players compete to become the "King of the Heap."

- **Real-time Leaderboard**: Compete with other players across different time periods
- **Stink Score System**: Earn points based on transaction frequency and volume
